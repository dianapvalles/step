      <h1>Diana's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am STEP intern studying <b>Computer Science</b> in

         working remotely from Mexico. Here's a picture

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I have the oportunity to study abroad bacause I live in one of the borders 
        with the US. When I was little my ideas were influeced by a lot of people 
        due to my country's environment. When I turned 8 years old, I started to 
        practice Taekwondo, which was a turning point in my life. That environment
        showed my different perspectives of life, specially when it came to gender 
        equality.</p>
        <br />

      <h2>Revelant Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>[High School] Analyzed lake water from my town's Central's park. The purpose
            was to research the living beings in the water that were turning the water green
            as time passed.</li>
        <li>[UTEP] Worked with linked lists and sorting concepts to translate RNA sequences 
            to Amino Acid in one of the lab assignments.</li>
        <li>[UTEP] Worked with stacks and queues by using arithmetic expressions stored in
            binary trees using postfix notation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why do I enjoy photographing? </h3>
        <p>Photography adds too much value to our lives. I like to re-live moments by just looking at
          old photos. It is a way to share our life experiences with others. It also lets you explore 
          your creative side.</p>
          <br />
      
      <h2>Hidden Talent? </h2>
          <p>I believe I am good at sports. I particularly spent several years practicing
              Taekwondo and got my black belt on September 2015. I coached multiple kids in
              tournaments and gave some classes too.</p>
